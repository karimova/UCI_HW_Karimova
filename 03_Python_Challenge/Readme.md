# **Python Challenge**

Two directories were created: `PyBank` and  `PyPoll`.

* Each folder inside has the following:

  * **main.py** - it is the main script to run for data analysis.
  * **analysis** - it is a folder that contains the text file that has the results from your analysis.

## PyBank

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of `Profit/Losses` over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in `Profit/Losses` over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* The final script print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
