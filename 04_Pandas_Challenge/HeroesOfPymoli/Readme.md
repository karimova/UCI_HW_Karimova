# **Pandas Challenge "Heroes Of Pymoli"**

For this assignment, I have completed `HeroesOfPymoli` Data Challenge.

Jupyter notebook was used to run the analysis. 

[Jupyter notebook file](HeroesOfPymoli_NVK.ipynb) - Use this script to see the following results.


## **Input Data**

Initial Data of "Heroes Of Pymoli" can be found in the [purchase_data.csv]("Resources/purchase_data.csv") file.

As final considerations:

* You must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
* You must submit a link to your Jupyter Notebook with the viewable Data Frames.
* You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* See [Example Solution](HeroesOfPymoli/HeroesOfPymoli_starter.ipynb) for a reference on expected format.
