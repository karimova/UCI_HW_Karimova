# **Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?**

## **Input Data**

To run these scripts yo will need:

* Install `citypy` in your python environment (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy)

* Create two API Keys and store them in the 'api_keys.py':

    `weather_api_key` - OpenWeatherMap API Key (https://openweathermap.org/)
    
    `g_key` - Google API Key (https://console.developers.google.com/getting-started) 
    
## **Part I - WeatherPy**

In this part, a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator was created.

In the first step, a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships were created:

![humidity](WeatherPy/Images/City_Latitude_vs_Humidity.png)


![cloudiness](WeatherPy/Images/City_Latitude_vs_Cloudiness.png)


![wind](WeatherPy/Images/City_Latitude_vs_Wind_Speed.png)

## Conclutions - Part I.

* Highest temperature is found for cities with latitudes between 20 and -20. Temperature significantly drops with increasing the latitude.

## **Part II - VacationPy**
